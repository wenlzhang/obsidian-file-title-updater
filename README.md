# File Title Updater

[![GitHub release (Latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/wenlzhang/obsidian-file-title-updater)](https://github.com/wenlzhang/obsidian-file-title-updater/releases) ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/wenlzhang/obsidian-file-title-updater/total?color=success)

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that synchronizes titles between filename, frontmatter, and first heading in your notes.

## Features

This plugin helps maintain consistency between the three places where a note's title can appear:

1. The filename
2. The `title` field in the frontmatter
3. The first level 1 heading (`#`) in the note

The plugin provides four commands:

- **Sync titles using default source**: Uses the default source (configurable in settings) to update all other title locations
- **Sync titles using filename as source**: Uses the filename to update frontmatter title and first heading
- **Sync titles using frontmatter as source**: Uses the frontmatter title to update filename and first heading
- **Sync titles using first heading as source**: Uses the first level 1 heading to update filename and frontmatter title

### Smart Behavior

The plugin includes several intelligent features:

- **Detects already synchronized titles**: If all three titles are already the same, the plugin will notify you and skip unnecessary updates
- **Proper spacing**: Ensures exactly one empty line between frontmatter and the first heading
- **Handles edge cases**: Properly creates first headings when none exist and provides helpful error messages
- **Handles illegal characters**: Automatically sanitizes titles when updating filenames to remove or replace characters that aren't allowed in filenames

## Why use this plugin?

Having the same title in multiple places provides redundancy and makes your notes more accessible:

- Consistent filenames make it easier to find notes in your file system
- Frontmatter titles enable better metadata management and can be used with plugins like Dataview
- First-level headings provide visual context when reading the note
