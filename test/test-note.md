# Test Note Content

This is a test note to verify that the File Title Updater plugin works correctly.

The plugin should be able to:
1. Update the frontmatter title based on the filename
2. Update the first heading based on the filename
3. Update the filename based on the frontmatter title
4. Update the filename based on the first heading

Let's test all these scenarios!
